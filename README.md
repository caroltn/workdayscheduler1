# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

#Usage
This simple calendar application allows the user to save events for each hour of a standard business day. Each time block is color coded to indicated whether it is in the past, present, or future.
When the user clicks into a timeblock, they are able to enter in an event. When the user clicks the save button, the text input for that event is saved in local storage. Using the local storage allows the user to refresh the page and have their saved events show up.
